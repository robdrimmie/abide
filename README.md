To this point I've been poking and experimenting with electron and interacting with slack directly. I have poked at it all enough to have a very basic understanding of how I think things should behave and since I struggle so much with new project file structure and since I want to experiment with react anyway and since there's so much stuff done for me, the next important thing to do is switch to the large boilerplate project and to the npm slack majigger.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/slack

also hey, that second one is brian leroux and features bithound points. So, yep good choice!
